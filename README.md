# Naou

An iOS app that syncs calendar events and reminders into a single, simple view for ease of use and reference, giving you a look at your day without switching apps. <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/page-one/id1274185791?mt=8">Click here to download</a>, or search "Naou" on the App Store.

When I set out to build Naou, I had no experience with app development, but I read the Swift documentation, watched tutorials, and most importantly, worked hard to create the product I envisioned. Within a month, I had a practical, user-friendly application ready for launch.

My goal was to develop an app that puts both events and reminders in one place. There are plenty of calendar and checklist apps out there, but with the air-tight lock Apple has on its ecosystem, directly connecting to their event and reminder database removes the middle man for the user, giving them one page to see their whole schedule.

This project allowed me to improve my skills in Swift programming, Xcode, and UI design. With each update I release, it takes me even less time to add useful features.
